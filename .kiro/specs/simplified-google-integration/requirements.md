# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines a simplified version of the Personal Automation Bot that focuses exclusively on Google service integrations (Calendar, Gmail, and Drive) with a streamlined authentication process. The goal is to create a more focused and user-friendly bot that handles the most essential productivity tasks while simplifying the setup and authentication process.
